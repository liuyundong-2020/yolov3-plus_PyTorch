# yolov3-plus_PyTorch
A better PyTorch version of YOLOv3. 

I call it "YOLOv3Plus"~

It is not the final version. I'm still trying to make it better and better.

# A strong and better YOLOv3 PyTorch

In this project, you can enjoy several excellent detectors: 

- YOLOv3Plus with (my CSPDarkNet-53)

Of course, the CSPDarknets used in these new models are all trained by myself on ImageNet. My CSPDarknet is a little different from the one used in YOLOv4 and YOLOv5. I referred to YOLOv4, YOLOv5 and Scaled-YOLOv4. For more details, you can read my backbone files in ```backbone\cspdarknet.py```. Attention, I do not deploy mish activation function in my CSPDarkNet53 as the mish is not efficient.

You can download my cspdarknet my models from the above links.

I'm trying to optimize this project.
