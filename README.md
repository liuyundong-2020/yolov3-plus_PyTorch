# yolov3-plus_PyTorch
A better PyTorch version of YOLOv3. 

I call it "YOLOv3Plus"~

It is not the final version. I'm still trying to make it better and better.

# A strong YOLOv3 PyTorch

In this project, you can enjoy several excellent detectors: 

YOLOv3Plus: 
- YOLOv3Plus (with my Darknet53)
- YOLOv3Plus-x (with my CSPDarknet-X)
- YOLOv3Plus-l (with my CSPDarknet-large)
- YOLOv3Plus-m (with my CSPDarknet-medium)
- YOLOv3Plus-s (with my CSPDarknet-small)

YOLOv3Slim:
- YOLOv3Slim (with my Darknet_tiny)
- YOLOv3Slim-csp (with my CSPDarknet-tiny )

Of course, the CSPDarknets used in these new models are all trained by myself on ImageNet. My CSPDarknet is a little different from the one used in YOLOv4 and YOLOv5. I referred to YOLOv4, YOLOv5 and Scaled-YOLOv4. For more details, you can read my backbone files in ```backbone\cspdarknet.py```.

You can download my cspdarknet my models from the above links.

I'm trying to optimize this project.
